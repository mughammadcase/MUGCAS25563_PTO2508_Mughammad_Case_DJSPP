# 🎧 Podcast Explorer

A modern React podcast application that allows users to discover, explore and listen to podcasts with a seamless audio experience. Users can browse shows, search and filter content, favourite episodes, switch between light and dark themes, and continue listening while navigating throughout the application.

This project was built as the final portfolio piece for the CodeSpace DJS React module and focuses on building a polished, production-ready application using modern React best practices.
